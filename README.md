Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The requirements for this project was to develop a weight tracking app using Android Studio. The weight tracker app will allow the user to login, store their current weight, daily weight, and goal weight, they can see the previous data/weight from previous days. 


What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
There were multiple screens that were necessary for this app. The user would need these screens to use the app correctly and efficiently. There is a login screen for the user so that they can access their account. There is a data screen so that they can see their history and understand how their weight tracking journey is going. There is a data input screen so that the user can input their daily weight. The UI designs kept the user in mind by making these pages. They are all seperate so that the user knows what to do and it isnt overcrowded. They user can see the page and instantly understand that they have to input their age or username/password. 



How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
I did a lot of planning before I started the process of coding the app. There is a lot that goes into, even the most basic, android apps. I made sure I understood the project requirements and I hit them all. This can be used in the future becasue almost every app uses the same foundation as this app that I made. I will use the login page for almost every app. I will include a database in almost everyapp so I can store the user's data and have access to it. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
I did a lot of manual testing. I would run the code as I was developing it to ensure that each funciton is working correctly. I then made example accounts to see if I can create a new user and then tested the remaining functions of the app. It is very important to test the code. It is a huge deal when you forget to check even the smalled function and then find out it wasnt working the entire time. 



Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I did a lot of innovation actions when I was developing the front end portion of the project. I initially started with basic textboxes and text, but as I went on, I decided to change the components to better display the information to the user. 


In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I feel like I was really good at the front end. I currently work as a software/systems engineer and at work I use winforms to develop the front end of the code. It is similar to the Android Studio front end development. I was able to put the winform skills to good use for this project.
